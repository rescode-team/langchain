# SQL with LLaMA2

This template allows you to chat with a SQL database in natural language using LLaMA2.

It is configured to use [Replicate](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/replicate).

But, it can be adapted to any API that support LLaMA2, including [Fireworks](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/fireworks) and others.

See related templates `sql-ollama` and `sql-llamacpp` for private, local chat with SQL.

## Installation
```bash
# from inside your LangServe instance
poe add sql-llama2
```
