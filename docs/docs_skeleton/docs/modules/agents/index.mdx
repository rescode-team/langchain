# Agents

The core idea of agents is to use an LLM to choose a sequence of actions to take.
In chains, a sequence of actions is hardcoded (in code).
In agents, a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order.

Some important terminology (and schema) to know:

1. `AgentAction`: This is a dataclass that represents the action an agent should take. It has a `tool` property (which is the tool that should be invoked) and a `tool_input` property (the input to that tool)
2. `AgentFinish`: This is a dataclass that signifies that the agent has finished and should return to the user. It has a `return_values` parameter, which is a dictionary to return. It often only has one key - `output` - that is a string, and so often it is just this key that is returned.
3. `intermediate_steps`: These represent previous agent actions and corresponding outputs that are passed around. These are important to pass to future iteration so the agent knows what work it has already done. This is typed as a `List[Tuple[AgentAction, Any]]`. Note that observation is currently left as type `Any` to be maximally flexible. In practice, this is often a string.

There are several key components here:

## Agent

This is the chain responsible for deciding what step to take next.
This is powered by a language model and a prompt.
The inputs to this chain are:

1. List of available tools
2. User input
3. Any previously executed steps (`intermediate_steps`)

This chain then returns either the next action to take or the final response to send to the user (`AgentAction` or `AgentFinish`).

Different agents have different prompting styles for reasoning, different ways of encoding input, and different ways of parsing the output.
For a full list of agent types see [agent types](/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/)

## Tools

Tools are functions that an agent calls.
There are two important considerations here:

1. Giving the agent access to the right tools
2. Describing the tools in a way that is most helpful to the agent

Without both, the agent you are trying to build will not work.
If you don't give the agent access to a correct set of tools, it will never be able to accomplish the objective.
If you don't describe the tools properly, the agent won't know how to properly use them.

LangChain provides a wide set of tools to get started, but also makes it easy to define your own (including custom descriptions).
For a full list of tools, see [here](/docs/modules/agents/tools/)

## Toolkits

Often the set of tools an agent has access to is more important than a single tool.
For this LangChain provides the concept of toolkits - groups of tools needed to accomplish specific objectives.
There are generally around 3-5 tools in a toolkit.

LangChain provides a wide set of toolkits to get started.

## AgentExecutor

The agent executor is the runtime for an agent.
This is what actually calls the agent and executes the actions it chooses.
Pseudocode for this runtime is below:

```python
next_action = agent.get_action(...)
while next_action != AgentFinish:
    observation = run(next_action)
    next_action = agent.get_action(..., next_action, observation)
return next_action
```

While this may seem simple, there are several complexities this runtime handles for you, including:

1. Handling cases where the agent selects a non-existent tool
2. Handling cases where the tool errors
3. Handling cases where the agent produces output that cannot be parsed into a tool invocation
4. Logging and observability at all levels (agent decisions, tool calls) either to stdout or [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).

## Other types of agent runtimes

The `AgentExecutor` class is the main agent runtime supported by LangChain.
However, there are other, more experimental runtimes we also support.
These include:

- [Plan-and-execute Agent](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/plan_and_execute)
- [Baby AGI](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/baby_agi)
- [Auto GPT](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/autogpt)
