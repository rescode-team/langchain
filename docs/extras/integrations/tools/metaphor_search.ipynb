Early-stage companies showing leading indicators of future greatness. Curated by NFX.</em></p>\\n<p></p>\\n<p>No doubt generative AI is extremely <a href=\"https://www.nfx.com/post/find-the-fast-moving-water\">fast-moving water</a>. But while media hype focuses on incumbents and household names, we’re doubling down on the “AI underground.”</p>\\n<p>The generative AI groundswell is disproportionately fueled by a dense network of exceptional, early-stage companies. We’ve seen it growing throughout San Francisco, in “Cerebral Valley” at NFX HQ, inside hacker houses, and via 100’s of meetings with up-and-coming AI founders.</p>\\n<p>After we open-sourced our <a href=\"https://www.nfx.com/post/generative-ai-tech-market-map\">Generative AI market map</a> a few months ago, we went to work analyzing this network for early indicators of future greatness. It is going to produce the next generation of unicorns, at a faster rate and at lower cost than any other startups before them.</p>\\n<p>Today we are making public our findings. Meet the <a href=\"https://www.nfx.com/post/generative-ai-hot-75-list?#AI-Hot-75\">AI Hot 75</a>.</p>\\n<h2><strong>Identifying the AI Hot 75 </strong></h2>\\n<p>Broadly speaking, we searched for leading indicators that an early-stage generative AI company has broken into the right networks and has found a “white hot center” (a highway to massive growth).</p>\\n<p>With those guiding principles in place, we gave preference to early-stage companies generally at the Seed and Series A stage. We narrowed the list according to: total amount raised, status of key investors, proximity to a geographical AI center of excellence, and “buzz” – which we imputed from various virality, traction, and WOM factors.</p>\\n<p>We finalized our selections based on in-network reputation –\\xa0i.e. if a company has been recommended or regarded by peers or experts in our network.</p>\\n<p>This list will look different from many that you’ve already seen. While some of the companies are household names already, most aren’t the biggest companies out there – yet.</p>\\n<p>Instead, these are the companies indicative of the next generation. The ones with notable momentum. The hot ones worth following.</p>\\n<h2><strong>AI Hot 75</strong></h2>\\n<p><em>In addition to using proprietary NFX data for this list, we also referred to Pitchbook, Crunchbase, our network of friends and founders, </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFX/status/1624103283236425729\"><em>The NFX AI Social Club</em></a><em>, and used ChatGPT to stress test analysis and language as well. </em></p>\\n</div></div>'), DocumentContent(id='i4k-4QKod9mMo2bi8m19bw', url='https://venturebeat.com/ai/10-new-ai-unicorns-flying-high-in-2022/', title='10 new AI unicorns flying high in 2022', extract='<div><div>\\n\\t<article>\\n\\t<div>\\n\\t<div>\\n<p><em>Check out all the on-demand sessions from the Intelligent Security Summit <a href=\"https://avolio.swapcard.com/intelligentsecuritysummit2022/registrations/Start?utm_source=vb&amp;utm_medium=boiler&amp;utm_content=ondemand&amp;utm_campaign=IS22_BoilerPlates\">here</a></em>.</p>\\n<hr />\\n</div><p>Technology venture capital deals may be <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/corporate-investors-fill-startup-funding-gap-as-vc-firms-pull-back-11655851713\">slowing down</a>, but investment in artificial intelligence (AI) companies continues to boom.
